# Compass UOL Internship First Project

## Overview
Welcome to the blog page developed as the first project for the Compass UOL internship. This project was created to apply the knowledge gained in the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript learning track. As an intern at Compass UOL, I had the opportunity to design and implement a blog page with various functionalities.


## Functionalities

- **Post List Display:** The main page showcases a list of posts, each presented in a card format.
- **Card Details:** Cards provide a glimpse of the posts, featuring cover images, titles, and brief content descriptions.
- **Clickable Cards:** Users can click on individual cards, redirecting them to a dedicated page displaying the full content of the selected post.
- **Page Details:** The dedicated post page includes a list of user comments discussing the specific post.
